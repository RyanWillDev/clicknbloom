      <p class="about-desc">I started my little shop when my family was going through a hard time. We didn't have enough money for our bills or food. Opening up this shop, gave me the chance to still be at home with my kids, but help provide for my family as well. I started slowly in 2013 and every year, I have grown more and more. Since then, I've learned so much and can't wait to show everyone what I can do next. <br><br>I have changed my shop name and image. While I am no longer Icing and Ink Boutique, I am still the same shop. I just felt like I outgrew that name. I am now Click and Bloom, A Tutu Boutique. I really love what I do. I love seeing how excited the kids are when they wear my tutus. I love being able to create something and having people love it as much as I do. Thank you for visiting. I do hope I can make something special for you one day! Have a blessed day!</p>
